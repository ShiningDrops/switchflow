Thank you for downloading the SwitchFlow Reverse Proxy server.
Your feedback is greatly appreciated. 

The server features support for virtual host redirection, and can
spread the load from one IP address with multiple virtual host addresses across 
multiple backend servers.  This can be used in environments that host many 
web sites, but have a limited number of IP addresses.

This build has been tested on Linux 2.6 x86 kernels.

== Quick Start ==

The server can be started with:

sfrp -f /path/to/config/file

With no parameters the server looks for the configuration 
file at /etc/sfrp.conf

All errors are logged to syslogd

sfrp --version prints the current build
sfrp --copyright prints the copyright information

An example configuration file is included.
